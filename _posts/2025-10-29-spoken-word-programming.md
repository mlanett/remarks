Gergey in his [Pragmatic Engineer](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/i/177384640/wispr-flow-a-new-modality-for-programming) newletter wrote about companies using voice input. He visited [Wispr Flow](https://wisprflow.ai/) which makes *dictation* software that can fix up what you say automatically e.g. turning "let’s start a server on localhost 3000… no, sorry, localhost 8000" into "let’s start a server on localhost:8000" (notice that the software is url-aware). People are apparently fond of the [BOYA microphone](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BF969RVP) which is directionally sensitive so that one can speak very quietly into it even in an open office, get picked up, and not include surrounding noises.
