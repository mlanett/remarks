title: "cursor skills"

Erik Zakariasson [posted](https://x.com/ericzakariasson/status/1983945740411138337) about some Cursor "commands" - which seem similar to Claude "skills".

- [deslop](https://t.co/ufnOZMPzIk) Removes stuff which a human wouldn't add.
- [create pr](https://t.co/9woW7pwz5Y) How to use `gh` to open a good PR.
- [commit](https://t.co/LUHcdONDGi) How to review code to be sure that it is relevant to the last work we did, and commit it.
- [weekly review](https://t.co/wkcxUgTb8q) How to review the past week of commit to create a summary of what we've done.
- [fix merge conflict](https://t.co/YlPbpaeYPI) How to detect and resolve conflicts, then validate the results using tests, and finally to commit it.

These all look like good starting points but will need revision to work for me.
